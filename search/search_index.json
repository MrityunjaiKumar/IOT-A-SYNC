Pinout diagram Basic functions The pins of ESP32 is connected to various connectors of IOT-A-SYNC, verify it before starting Some of the basic functions that can be used are given below: pinMode This function lets the controller know weather the GPIO pin will act as Input or Output. digitalWrite This command instructs a particular GPIO pin to go logic HIGH or logic LOW as per the arguments. 1 2 digitalWrite ( GPIO_pin_number , HIGH ); //This gives logic HIGH (3.3V) digitalWrite ( GPIO_pin_number , LOW ); //This gives logic LOW (0V) digitalRead This command checks the digital logic voltage at a particular pin specified as arguments. It returns a boolean TRUE if logic detected is HIGH at that pin and FALSE if logic LOW is detected. 1 digitalRead ( GPIO_pin_number ); analogRead This reads the analog value at the pin specified as argument. Since it has 12bit ADC (analog-to-digital convertor) it can only read voltages in discrete intervals of 2^8 (i.e 2^(no. of bits)), therefore it can read upto an accuracy of 3.3/(2^8) = 0.805mV. 1 analogRead ( GPIO_pin_number ); Writing Ananlog values ESP32 does not have analogWrite() function. So we use different methods to generate analog signals. One such method is using PWM and other is using the inbuilt DAC hardware. Using DAC DacWrite(GPIO_pin,value); //'value' defined ranges from 0 to 4095 as it uses a 12 bit DAC. Using PWM Here we use the concept that in a pulsed wave the average output is (max Voltage)X(duty cycle). Thus this method can be used to vary the brightness of an LED, vary the sound in a speaker, vary the speed of motors and many more. For this, we define a particular frequency with which we want to send PWM (For lighting LEDs it should be much higher than the persistence of vision, for motors it should be according to the time constant). The duty cycle can be varied by keeping the output HIGH for some time and LOW for the rest of the time. See this example to get an overview on how to code for PWM. delay() This function lets the controller to wait for certain millisecons (as specified in the argumenmt) before executing the next instruction. When the delay is executed, the controller cannot do any other task, it\u2019s like being in a \u2018paused\u2019 state. 1 delay ( 1000 ); //delay of 1000ms i.e.1sec Similar function is delayMicroseconds() . Millis() - This function returns the time in milliseconds that have been passed since program execution has started. It has overflow time of about 50 days! Interrupts Interrupt is a signal emitted by hardware or software when a process or an event needs immediate attention. It alerts the processor to a high priority process requiring interruption of the current working process. In I/O devices one of the bus control lines is dedicated for this purpose and is called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). When a device raises an interrupt at lets say process i, the processor first completes the execution of instruction i. Then it loads the Program Counter (PC) with the address of the first instruction of the ISR. Before loading the Program Counter with the address, the address of the interrupted instruction is moved to a temporary location. Therefore, after handling the interrupt the processor can continue with process i+1. Interrupts here can be callled in four ways/Modes:- LOW to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin is low, CHANGE to trigger the interrupt whenever the pin changes value RISING to trigger when the pin goes from low to high, FALLING for when the pin goes from high to low. All GPIO pins can be configered as Interrupt pins attachInterrupt() This tells the controller on which pin the interrupt has to be attached and what ISR does it corresponds. attachInterrupt(GPIO_Pin_no, ISR, Mode); 1 2 //'ISR' is a function which is called when interrupt is received. ISR has to be as small as possible. //'Mode' specifies the event when interrupt should be called. detachInterrupt(pin_no) It disables the interrupt at that pin. Serial Class This is a class predefined in the \u201cArduino.h\u201d library for serial communication. It consists of many functions which are used for manipulating data. This has extreme importance in UART communication.

GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. Here, we will learn and master all the basics of Git and GitHub. Git Installation For Windows To download and install Git for Windows, go to this link. This will download the installer. Run the installer, and go along with the default installation settings. Once installation completes, the Git commands can be run from the Command Prompt or Windows Powershell. For Linux On the Linux terminal, run the following command- 1 > sudo apt-get install git Configuration Git for Windows provides an application called Git Bash, which provides an emulation layer for Git command line experience. In order to use it, simply launch the Git Bash application. To use Git commands for a specific directory, navigate to the destination by using the change directory command. Alternatively, open the destination folder, right click and select the \u2018Git Bash Here\u2019 option from the menu. After installation, it is ideal to run the following commands from Git Bash to provide configuration information- 1 2 $ git config --global user.name \"user-name\" $ git config --global user.email \"user-email\" Basic Git Commands Before we move on to Git commands, it is crucial to understand how the process of using Git actually works. Essentially, when you save the current state of your project in Git, it takes a snapshot of what your project looks like at that very instant. Since we can save many versions of the same project in Git, if we encounter an error during the course of development, it is possible to revert back to the last version of the project that worked, using Git. This eliminates the time and energy that we would otherwise have spent in starting all over. Git has 3 states your files can reside in: Committed means that the data is safely stored in the local database. Modified means that the files have been changed but not committed yet. Staged means that the files have been marked in their current version, and can be committed. The project resides in our local directory or repository. When we make changes to files in such a directory, the files are said to have been \u2018modified\u2019. When we stage a file, we add a snapshot of it to the staging area. Once we commit such a file, it\u2019s snapshot from the staging area is saved permanently in the Git directory. Use the git init command to create a new Git repository from a working directory on the system. On the Git Bash, navigate to the working directory, and run the following- 1 $ git init After this, add the files to the staging area. 1 $ git add . to add all the files in the working repository OR 1 $ git add filename to add a specific file. Now, these files are present in the staging area. In order to commit them to the Git directory, run the following command- 1 $ git commit -m \"MESSAGE\" The message string should preferably be something that neatly sums up the changes that have been made, making the version more recognizable. Git and GitHub basic commands As discussed earlier, GitHub is an online cloud service built around Git Tools. It makes it extremely convenient for developers to collaborate and share repositories, codes, etc. It has powerful features like pull, merge and fork, which facilitate collaboration. To use Github, first set up a GitHub account. Next, create a new repository. Add in the details, like the name, description etc., and create the repository. Once this is done, we need to establish a remote connection between the GitHub repository that we have just created, and the Git Repository on our system. To do this, run the following command- 1 $ git remote add remote-name github-repository-url Replace the remote-name with a name of your choice, and the github-repository-url with the url of the repository you want to add a remote connection to. Next, we push the files in our git directory to this GitHub repository. 1 $ git push remote-name branch-name A branch name can be specified if the files have to be pushed to a branch other than the master branch. Branching of GitHub Repositories Branches are used to isolate work without affecting other branches. It can be used to develop new features, fix bugs, and experiment with new ideas. In order to create a branch, simply navigate to the main page of the repository and click the branch selector menu. There, enter the name of the branch you wish to create. When we have a project with multiple branches, sometimes we need to work in the branches other than master. To do this, run the following command from Git Bash- 1 $ git checkout branch-name Cloning a GitHub Repository To clone a GitHub Repository in your system, run the following command and replace the repository-url with the url of the repository you wish to clone- 1 $ git clone repository-url Forks and Pull Requests To fork someone else\u2019s GitHub Repository to your account, first go to the repository you wish to fork, and click the \u2018Fork\u2019 option. Forking will create your own version of the desired repository. Any changes that you make and commit will reflect in your forked version of the repository, and not the original. However, there is a mechanism in place, which allows you to request the original owner of the repository to include the changes you have made and incorporate them in their repositories, if they so see fit. This is called sending a pull request. Choose the compare across forks option. On the left, select the repository and it\u2019s branch that you wish to merge with, and on the right, select the repository and the branch you want to merge to the original repository. Pull requests can also be made across branches of the same repository. Once you select the repositories, GitHub will verify if they can be merged. If so, it will open up a menu for you to fill details about the pull request in. You can specify a title, detailed description etc. Once these details are filled, click on \u2018Create a Pull Request\u2019. A request will be sent to the owner of the first repository to review the changes. If approved, your repository will be merged with the original.
